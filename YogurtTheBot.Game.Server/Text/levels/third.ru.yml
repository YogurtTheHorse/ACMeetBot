  Now, this level has wolves, hares and some grass. Forget Alex and the door. When you're done, there should be nothing here but the grass. Orders from the top.
  
  Yes, from the very top. Don't dwell on it, start solving already.

rabbits_starve: The hares have starved to death. Happy now?
  
herbivorous_wolves: Herbivorous wolves, sure

grass_eaten: A-a-and the grass is gone

last_grass: The grass was so close to exterminating itself, but one little blade fought back and survived. From it, all the grass grew right back

wolves_dead: The wolves ate each other, just like that

rabbits_dead: Oh wow, those hares just went berserk

last_rabbit: The last surviving female hare repopulated the whole tribe
